## Citi Bike Spatial Analysis


## Assignment 1 - Monthly Ridership Analysis
### I followed the instructions of the lab work and went through the whole process from getting data, merging and spatial analyzing the patterns. I also added explanations to the processes and the plots to make the notebook more presentable.


## Assignment 2 - Summer and Winter Months Analysis
### I splited the data according to summer months(June-September) and winter months(November-February), and then performed the analysis on each of the dataset, followed by comparisons. 

### Based on my final heat map plots, I concluded the following:

The heat maps show the **hot spots** and **cold spots** of the summer and winter citi-bike ride counts based on **Moran's I Statistics**(Local). <br/>
**Auto-correlation** occurs in both maps in a similar manner, indicated by the similar color patterns. This shows that although the ride counts in summer months are higher than that of winter months, the relationships between the ridership within a borough tract and its neighbour tracts have a similar pattern for both categories(Neighbours are weighted).

**Similarity--** Hot spots concentrate in downtown and midtown west Manhattan areas; 
cold spots are mostly observed in uptown east Manhattan, Long Island City(Queens), and outter Brooklyn areas that have some distance from Manhattan.

**Difference--** There are slight differences in certain tract areas where the level of autocorrelation are not the same.
