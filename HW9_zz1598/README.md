## Assignment 1
### In this assignment I worked with Dongjie and I also discussed with Maisha and Christine for a better interpretation of the Fourier Series applications. I had a great experience going through the logical process from event detection to periodicity finding. In task 2, for the treads exploration task, in addition to using the handy functions, I also used my eyes to do the first round “filtering”— manually finding and dropping those with missing values or obviously with no steady trends.
