# HW11 Information
### I worked with Dongjie Fan(df1676) discussing about the logics and some function usages for these two assignments. 


## Assignment 1 - CUSP building on Brooklyn Map

### I followed the instruction and plotted the CUSP building in the map of selected Brooklyn census blocks. The data I used was an NYC census block shape file and coordinates of CUSP building. To find which census block contains the CUSP building, I looped over all the census block polygons and recorded the index when the building point is within a specific polygon.


## Assignment 2 - NYC Business Clustering
### I performed two clustering algorithms--KMeans and Hierarchical--on business establishments in NYC census blocks to explore the pattern of these time series from 1994 to 2014. 

### I downloaded business establishment data (1994 to 2014) and merged them with the census block data by the unique zipcodes. To plot the KMeans clustering result on a two dimensional plane, I used the 2000 and 2010 business establishment data points and their clustering centers. Finally I plotted and compared the maps that showed the clusters.
