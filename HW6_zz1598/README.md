# HW6 Information

### * Groupwork: I worked with Dongjie Fan on the mini project and discuss through data munging and viusalization parts for homework assignment 1.


## Assignment 1
### I went through the data processing and felt quite challenging especially for the Likelihood test section. Dongjie explained to me how to create a graph to visualize the likelihood. 

## Citi Bike Mini Project
### We used Latex and worked together to structure our project report. After doing statistical tests and agreeing on the results we got, I wrote mainly for the Abstract, Introduction as Data Availability sections. Doingjie performed and reviewed the tests as well as the reference, and he also created the PDF file with the Latex software.
