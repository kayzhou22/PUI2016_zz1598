## Review
### Data processing part for the plot
I really like the large subtitles you use for each step that leads the reader to the plot. I also like how you show the four selected colors using four solid cylinders(color samples). I can see how you create the random numbers and plot them in your graph. 

### Plot Evaluation- Clarity, Aesthetic, and Honesty
Your plot looks clear with titles, x and y labels and tickers. The data points are centered nicely in your plot. The size of the figure is also good. The data is honestly presented without hidding any information.
The only thing I would suggest is the colors of the datapoints. Although I like these four colors, when they are gathered together and overlapped, it is not easy to identify them. You might want to use the colors with more contrast. For instance, change the dark red(burgandy I suppose) color to another color in a more "yellowish" scale(a shade of yellow). Additionally, you could put a legend in your plot.



Nice work!
